This was such a beautiful book. I wasn't even planning any travel when I came across this and just started flipping through the pages. I really like the cover and all the large glossy photographs in this book. John Smith did a wonderful job with the photography. I've found a perfect home for this on my coffee table. I'm planning a trip to Paris and Barcelona soon and I know this will come in handy. In the meantime, it's perfect for assisting this armchair traveler!
